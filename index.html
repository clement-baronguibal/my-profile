      <p>About 2 years ago I discovered the art of dressing well. Through youtube videos, blogs, instagram accounts, I discovered that there is a whole world dedicated to menswear and more specifically classic style. After a few months of looking around, I decided to create an Instagram account dedicated to my “sartorial journey”. About a year and a half later, I have a growing community of people following my evolution in this world! It has become a passion as well as a way of life and I now approach everything with a different point of view : “quality, craftsmanship, and tradition, above all”.</p>

      <h2>📷 Video editing</h2>

      <p>My passion for video editing and shooting started early when I held my first camera as a very young child. Ever since then, I’ve always been drawn to these things. It all really started when we went on our usual trip to Corsica in the summer, and I decided that this time I was going to film everything. I started with a camera I borrowed from my father’s work, and bit by bit I got to own my own gear. I bought a drone, a camera, a sports camera. Now, I try to film every time we go on holiday. The amount of memories you create by keeping it all on tape is amazing. I even opened my Youtube channel about menswear to mix my two passions!</p>
